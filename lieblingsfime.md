#Plot
in 2067, a global famine caused humanity to abandon scientific pursuits such as space exploration. 
Ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is forced to work as a farmer. One day, Cooper experiences a gravitational
 "anomaly" in his daughter Murph's bedroom. He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates and arrives
 at a secret NASA facility headed by Professor Brand. Brand explains to Cooper that it is engaged in a
 secret mission to discover an exoplanet capable of supporting life and that he is working on a gravity-equation.
 He enlists Cooper's help to pilot an exploratory spacecraft with three other scientists – Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia. The crew travels through a wormhole on board the Endurance to pass through to another galaxy. Their mission is to investigate three planets, orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua, each of which was previously explored by a NASA scientist-explorer.
